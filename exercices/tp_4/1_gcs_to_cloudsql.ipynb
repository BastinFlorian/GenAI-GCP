      "RAG Definition\n",
      "Definition: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that combines retrieval-based and generation-based models. It enhances the capabilities of language models by providing them with access to external knowledge bases or documents during the generation process. This allows the model to generate more accurate and up-to-date information by retrieving relevant data instead of relying solely on its internal parameters.\n",
      "Benefits:\n",
      "\t•\tProduces more informed and factual responses.\n",
      "\t•\tCan handle queries about recent events not present in the training data.\n",
      "\t•\tReduces hallucinations common in language models.\n",
